# My work at PYMNTS

As a Senior Research Manager at PYMNTS, I lead large-scale, end-to-end research projects on how people and businesses navigate the digital economy — from payments and financial technologies to eCommerce, banking, and beyond.

I manage survey-based research from design to final deliverables, working closely with clients to shape their research questions, craft effective surveys, and translate data into meaningful insights. I also supervise a team of junior analysts and collaborate with writers and designers to turn complex findings into compelling narratives for wide audiences — including C-suite executives and major industry leaders.

My work at PYMNTS spans two key areas:

### 1. Client-Sponsored Research
I partner with global leaders in fintech, payments, and commerce to produce custom research that helps answer their most pressing questions. These projects often inform thought leadership and marketing strategy, and include everything from survey design to analysis, data visualization, and executive presentations.

### 2. Proprietary Benchmark Studies
In addition to client work, I independently manage several of PYMNTS’ flagship recurring studies — including our Paycheck-to-Paycheck series and Generational Pulse tracker. These monthly and quarterly benchmarks offer a consistent, data-driven view into consumer behavior, financial well-being, and broader economic trends. They’re designed not only to explain what’s happening in the economy, but to help shape how the industry thinks about and responds to change.

Below, you’ll find a selection of reports I’ve worked on, representing just some of the data-driven projects I’ve led or contributed to at PYMNTS. I try to keep this list updated regularly, though it’s not exhaustive—there’s always more data work happening behind the scenes.

In addition to the flagship reports featured here, my work also includes:

**Special Reports** – Creating tailored analyses and quick-turnaround reports to answer specific client or internal questions.

**Editorial Support** – Providing data insights and visualizations that support PYMNTS’ editorial team in developing articles, thought leadership, and industry commentary.

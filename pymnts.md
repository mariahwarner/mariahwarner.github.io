# My work at PYMNTS

As a Senior Research Manager at PYMNTS, I lead large-scale, end-to-end research projects on how people and businesses navigate the digital economy — from payments and financial technologies to eCommerce, banking, and beyond.

I manage survey-based research from design to final deliverables, working closely with clients to shape their research questions, craft effective surveys, and translate data into meaningful insights. I also supervise a team of junior analysts and collaborate with writers and designers to turn complex findings into compelling narratives for wide audiences — including C-suite executives and major industry leaders.

My work at PYMNTS spans two key areas:

### 1. Client-Sponsored Research
I partner with global leaders in fintech, payments, and commerce to produce custom research that helps answer their most pressing questions. These projects often inform thought leadership and marketing strategy, and include everything from survey design to analysis, data visualization, and executive presentations.

### 2. Proprietary Benchmark Studies
In addition to client work, I independently manage several of PYMNTS’ flagship recurring studies — including our Paycheck-to-Paycheck series and Generational Pulse tracker. These monthly and quarterly benchmarks offer a consistent, data-driven view into consumer behavior, financial well-being, and broader economic trends. They’re designed not only to explain what’s happening in the economy, but to help shape how the industry thinks about and responds to change.

Below, you’ll find a selection of reports I’ve worked on, representing just a few of the data-driven projects I’ve led or contributed to at PYMNTS.

# About Me

Outside of work, I spend most of my time doing something creative or competitive — usually both. I’m an avid tabletop board game player and love all kinds of crafting, including crocheting, sewing, and whatever new hobby I’ve picked up that month. I’m also a big live music fan and try to get to as many concerts as I can. A few of my favorite artists are AJR, Twenty One Pilots, and Noah Kahan.

I grew up in New Hampshire and am a die-hard New England sports fan — yes, even now that I live in Columbus, Ohio with my partner, Alex, and our Black Lab, Luna. I went to college at Mississippi State, and while my roots are now Midwest-based, I’ll always have a soft spot for fall in New England and yelling at the TV during Patriots games.

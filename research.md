## Academic Research

Before I worked in industry, I was an academic researcher. My work spanned diverse fields—from genocide studies to the sociology of sport—but all of my projects were united by a central question: **how does human behavior unfold within social contexts, and what does that reveal about communities, identity, and belonging?**  

Through this lens, I designed and carried out large-scale surveys, conducted in-depth interviews, and analyzed patterns of behavior and community dynamics. My academic work not only advanced sociological theory but also demonstrated practical relevance, informing conversations in media, classrooms, and public forums.

Abstract: Using U.S. survey data (N = 3849), this study examined recognized sports-related mistreatment, investigated risk factors for it, and offered descriptive evidence of types of mistreatment and reasons for mistreatment. Logistic regression analyses emphasized social structural characteristics, childhood contexts that included youth sports experiences, and social and sport contexts in adulthood as predictors of mistreatment. Findings highlight that sports-related mistreatment is common. Evidence suggests greater risks for mistreatment for males and individuals who identify as a sexual minority, have health problems or disabilities, and have dealt with weight-related stigma and pressures. It also seems to be more common among those who are less popular and less athletic while growing up. Although sports-related mistreatment frequently occurs in various settings and contexts, elite sport contexts and more competitive settings may be more prone for mistreatment. Overall, these results suggest that the structures, cultures, and interactions surrounding sports need to become more focused on enhancing positive development, safety, inclusivity, and participant well-being.

Examining US Adults’ Beliefs and the Impact of Youth and Adult Sport Experiences](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ssj/aop/article-10.1123-ssj.2023-0143/article-10.1123-ssj.2023-0143.xml)**, *Sociology of Sport Journal*, 2025 

Abstract: This study uses National Sports and Society Survey (N = 3,993) data and regression analyses to investigate the racial/ethnic diversity of sport participation experiences, perceptions of the impact of one’s athletic experiences, and beliefs about the effectiveness of sports in bringing different racial/ethnic groups together. We find that people overwhelmingly believe that sports bring different racial/ethnic groups together. Also, most individuals believe that their athletic experiences improved their understanding of people of other races and backgrounds. Although racial/ethnic diversity in sport seems to matter, subjective perceptions of the effects of one’s athletic experiences on understanding people of other races and backgrounds are more closely connected to one’s general beliefs about sports bringing different racial/ethnic groups together.

### Doctoral Dissertation

**A Different Kind of Neutral Zone: Exploring Sports Fan Communities as Sites of Political Tolerance in an Era of Division**, PhD Dissertation, The Ohio State University (2025)  

My dissertation investigated sports fandom as a social arena where people of different political and cultural identities interact. Using surveys of 30,000+ respondents, 20 in-depth interviews, and ethnography (particpanty observation), I demonstrated how fan communities can foster tolerance in unique ways.

### Broader Impact

- **Methodological Breadth:** Designed projects using mixed methods—surveys, interviews, observational analysis—to capture both quantitative patterns and qualitative depth.  
- **Public Communication:** My findings have been featured in podcasts, local news, and classroom settings, showing my ability to make research accessible beyond academia.  
- **Throughline to Industry:** Whether examining genocide survivors or sports fans, my focus has always been on understanding how people engage with each other and with institutions—a perspective I now apply in UX, market research, and people analytics.

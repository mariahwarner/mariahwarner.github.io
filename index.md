Hi, Dr. I’m Mariah Warner.

I’m a Senior Research Manager at PYMNTS, where I lead end-to-end research for high-profile clients, from survey development, to analysis, reporting, and strategic insights.

With a Ph.D. in Sociology, I bring a deep understanding of human behavior and rigorous methodological training to applied research. My work bridges the academic and business worlds, combining storytelling with strong statistical skills to answer complex questions and drive impact.

This site serves as a portfolio of my research — both industry and academic — including selected reports, visualizations, and media coverage. Whether I’m exploring how people use financial technology, what drives consumer behavior, or how cultural institutions shape everyday life, I care about research that is smart, clear, and meaningful.
